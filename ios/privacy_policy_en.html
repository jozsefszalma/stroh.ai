<h1>Privacy and Fair Use Policy</h1>
<p><b>Effective Date:</b> August 7, 2023</p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Welcome to our Application ("we", "us", or "our"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This document outlines our Privacy and Fair Use Policies, which detail the types of information we may collect from you, what you may provide when you use our Application ("App"), our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information, and our expectations regarding fair use of our App. User consent is obtained when the application is installed and first opened. If a user deletes their account (through the settings menu of the application), we consider the consent to be withdrawn.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect:</h2>
<p>The App collects the following types of information when you use it:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>User ID:</b> After your free trial has ended you may opt to continue using our App and create an account. In this case we rely on Apple as our authentication provider, enabling us to identify your account within our system. The User ID is a unique identifier provided by Apple through the 'Sign-in with Apple' functionality. </li>
<li><b>Precise Location:</b> With your permission, the App uses your precise location information to facilitate specific application functionalities. Your location data is a snapshot at the point in time when you actively submit a chat request, rather than constant tracking. After on-device processing only your approximate location is transmitted to our servers.  You may choose to not provide your precise location; to do this, toggle the 'Precise' button in the location permissions prompt when you first open the App. You may change this preference at any time in Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services, select our App, and then switch the Precise Location on or off as per your preference. Please note, if precise location is turned off, the accuracy of the responses provided by the App may be reduced.</li>
<li><b>Conversation History:</b> We collect your conversation history to ensure continuity and coherence in your ongoing conversation. </li>
<li>The justification for the data collection is that the application cannot function without the data discussed in this policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect:</h2>
<p>We want to emphasize that we do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), unique device IDs, or use cookies or other tracking technologies.</p>

<h2>App's Background Operation:</h2>
<p>To conserve your device's battery life, our App is designed to suspend operations when it's not on the screen or if your device is locked. The only exceptions are if you have in-app purchases that are currently being processed, or if you actively ask Siri to read out the last message for you.</p>

<h2>Use of Your Information:</h2>
<p>The information we collect is strictly used to facilitate specific application functionalities. We do not track our users or their activities beyond the scope of the App. Furthermore, we do not sell, trade, or distribute the collected data to third parties for marketing, advertising, or any purposes unrelated to the app's functionalities.</p>

<h2>Sharing of Information:</h2>
<p>When you actively submit a chat request, your approximate location and current conversation are shared with OpenAI due to our use of their API. You can review OpenAI's data usage policies at <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies">https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies</a>.</p>
<p>Our backend infrastructure is provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), and we use AWS's compute and storage infrastructure based in the EU. For more information, visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Transfer:</h2>
<p>When you actively submit a chat request, your approximate location and current conversation are transferred to the United States due to our use of OpenAI's GPT-4 API, which processes these API requests within the US. Your data is otherwise processed and stored within the European Union.</p>

<h2>Storage and Security of Information:</h2>
<p>Both we and OpenAI store your data for a maximum duration of 30 days. During this period, your data is encrypted and securely stored to protect against unauthorized access. After this period, your data is automatically deleted. We also encrypt all data during transfer to ensure your data security.</p>

<h2>Review of Information:</h2>
<p>We only review your information in cases of investigations related to potential misuse or abuse of our services, or when addressing customer service requests. We do not utilize your data for any other purposes.</p>

<h2>User Rights:</h2>
<p>As a user, you have the right to access, rectify, and port your data. To exercise these rights, please submit a customer service request from the settings menu of the application.</p>

<h2>User Age Limit:</h2>
<p>The application has an Age Rating of 17+ on the Apple App Store. We do not knowingly collect or maintain data from minors.</p>

<h2>Account and Data Deletion:</h2>
<p>You can request your account, messages, and location information stored on our servers to be deleted in the settings menu of the application. Your account will be flagged for deletion, and we commit to deleting your data within 7 calendar days. Please be aware that if you request your account to be deleted, you will lose any remaining credit balance, both trial and consumable in-app purchases. You may suspend the deletion process by explicitly requesting this the next time you attempt to sign-in with Apple in the application.</p>
<p>The data managed by OpenAI will not be deleted as it is not associated with your account. The data managed by OpenAI is governed by their policy and will be deleted within 30 days. For more information, visit <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies">OpenAI's data usage policies</a>.</p>

<h2>Fair Use Policy:</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to decline service to anyone, at any time. This includes, but is not limited to, the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Abuse of Apple Store Refunds:</b> Please avoid misuse of the Apple Store's refund system, such as repeated refund requests. Such activities may result in the suspension or termination of your account.</li>
<li><b>Compromising Security:</b> Activities such as hacking, penetration testing, or prompt injection attempts that could compromise our security are strictly prohibited. We uphold the integrity of our services and any attempt to compromise it may lead to account termination. If you come across any security vulnerabilities, we kindly request that you report them to us rather than exploiting them.</li>
<li><b>Misuse of Free Trial:</b> We offer a free trial at our sole discretion to help users get started. Misuse of the free trial may result in adjustment or withdrawal of the trial credits, and repeated misuse could lead to account suspension or termination. Your support, through actions like purchasing credits, plays a crucial role in helping us sustain and enhance our service.</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to amend our Privacy and Fair Use Policy at any time, and we recommend regular reviews. Your continued use of our App after any changes signifies your acceptance of those changes.</p>
